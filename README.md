# Imphash-Local
Many implementations for import hashing were either:
- out of date
- not quick enough
- or were online solutions which required payload submission

I wrote this local drag-and-drop imphash script quickly for personal use. I'm going to re-write this in C or something later to make it actually fast and not shitty - stay tuned :3

### Raw Python dependencies:

- PEFile
    - ("pip3 install pefile")
