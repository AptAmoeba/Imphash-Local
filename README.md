# Imphash-Local
Many implementations for import hashing were either:
- out of date
- not quick enough
- or were online solutions which required payload submission

 So, I wrote this local drag-and-drop imphash script. I'm going to re-write this in C or Rust or something to make it actually fast and not shitty - stay tuned :3
